{
"ID":"0", "Title":"INTERESTING", "Link":"google.com", "Vote":"1"
	,"replies":[{"Text":"0x0","ID":"0-0","Vote":"0"
	
			,"replies":[{"Text":"0x0x0","ID":"0-0-0","Vote":"0",
		
				"replies":[{"Text":"0x0x0x0","ID":"0-0-0-0","Vote":"0","replies":[]}]
				},
			
			{"Text":"0x0x1","ID":"0-0-1","Vote":"0","replies":[]}]},
		
		{"Text":"0x1","ID":"0-1","Vote":"0","replies":[]}]
		},

{
"ID":"13", "Title":"AWESOME STUFF", "Link":"reddit.com", "Vote":"2", "replies":[]}
